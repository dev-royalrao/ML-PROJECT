# 🤟 SignSense – Real-Time Sign Language to Text Translator

In an increasingly inclusive world, bridging communication gaps is crucial. **SignSense** is a deep learning–powered system that translates **static hand gestures** from sign language into readable text using a regular **webcam**. This project aims to make sign language more accessible by enabling real-time gesture recognition with an easy-to-use interface.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**SignSense** leverages computer vision and machine learning to:

- 🎥 Capture live webcam feed
- ✋ Detect static sign language gestures
- 🔤 Convert them into readable text in real-time
- 📦 Provide a complete offline solution for accessibility

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning model development
- **OpenCV** – Real-time webcam feed and image processing
- **NumPy, Pandas** – Data handling and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – Model training visualization

## 🔄 How It Works

- 📥 **Capture:** Webcam captures hand gesture images
- 🧠 **Predict:** Trained model classifies the gesture
- 📝 **Display:** Predicted character is shown as text
- 🔁 **Loop:** The process repeats in real-time for continuous input

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Webcam-enabled system
- Virtual environment (optional)
- Required Python packages (`requirements.txt`)

---

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SignSense.git
   cd SignSense
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the model (optional if using a pre-trained model):
   python train_model.py

5. Run the real-time gesture recognition app:
   python signsense_app.py

## 🗂️ Dataset
You can use:
•Public datasets like Kaggle ASL
•Or collect your own labeled images using the webcam

---

## 🧠 Key Features
•Accurate recognition of static ASL gestures
•Offline usage – no internet required
•Easily extendable with more signs or dynamic gestures
•Simple interface for demo and development

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
•🔄 Add support for dynamic (sequence-based) signs
•🌐 Deploy as a web or mobile app
•🗣️ Integrate text-to-speech for auditory feedback
•🔤 Multi-language output support
