🧠🤟 SignSense – Real-Time Sign Language to Text Translator
Welcome to SignSense – a smart and inclusive AI-powered system that translates static sign language gestures into readable text ✍️ using just a regular webcam 🎥.

In today's world 🌍 where communication should be inclusive for all, SignSense bridges the gap between the hearing-impaired community and those unfamiliar with sign language. Built with ❤️ accessibility and practicality in mind, this project leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) to make gesture-based communication more universally understood.
