SignSense – Real-Time Sign Language to Text Translator 🤟
SignSense is an AI-powered system designed to recognize static hand gestures from sign language and convert them into readable text using a regular webcam. In an increasingly connected world, technology plays a vital role in making communication more inclusive—especially for individuals from the hearing-impaired community.

While sign language is a powerful communication medium, it is not widely understood outside its community. SignSense aims to bridge this gap by combining machine learning and computer vision to offer a real-time, accessible, and user-friendly solution.
